Sodalord Client
===============

`client/` holds the application running on the Kiosk PC by the vending machine. 
Customers will use this application to authenticate and make purchases. 

The application uses a command line user interface and makes HTTPS requests to
the Sodalord server (see `server/`) to authenticate users and authorize vends.
